##What is Dynamo?     
##  Dynamo是什么
Dynamo is, quite literally, what you make it. Working with Dynamo may include using the application, either in connection with other Autodesk software or not, engaging a Visual Programming process, or participating in a broad community of users and contributers.

就是使用Dynamo应用程序与其他Autodesk软件进行可视化编程过程.

###The Application
###dynamo 运用

Dynamo, the application, is a software that can be downloaded and run in either stand-alone "Sandbox" mode or as a plug-in for other software like Revit or Maya. It is described as:

Dynamo应用程序是一种软件,可以下载并运行在独立的电脑上，或作为其他软件的插件如Revit或maya雅。它被描述为:


> A visual programming tool that aims to be accessible to both non-programmers and programmers alike. It gives users the ability to visually script behavior, define custom pieces of logic, and script using various textual programming languages.


> 可视化编程工具,旨在可以非程序员和程序员。它给用户视觉上的脚本行为的能力,自定义的逻辑,使用各种文本和脚本编程语言。

2. Download the installer

###The Process
Once we've installed the application, Dynamo will enable us to work within a Visual Programming process wherein we connect elements together to define the relationships and the sequences of actions that compose custom algorithms. We can use our algorithms for a wide array of applications - from processing data to generating geometry - all in realtime and without writing a lick of ```code```.

> Add elements, connect, and we are off and running with creating Visual Programs.

###The Community
Dynamo wouldn't be what it is without a strong group of avid users and active contributers. Engage the community by following the Blog, adding your work to the Gallery, or discussing Dynamo in the Forum.

###The Platform
Dynamo is envisioned as a visual programming tool for designers, allowing us to make tools that make use of external libraries or any Autodesk product that has an API. With Dynamo Studio we can can develop programs in a "Sandbox" style application - but the Dynamo ecosystem continues to grow.

The source code for the project is open-source, enabling us to extend its functionality to our hearts content. Check out the project on Github and browse the Works in Progress of users customizing Dynamo.
